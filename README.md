# FlowerResNet

![FlowerResNet Logo](logo.png)

This GitHub project showcases the classification of flower images using a custom ResNet model implemented in PyTorch. The Flowers-299 dataset, consisting of 299 flower classes, is utilized for training and evaluation. The project covers various aspects including data preprocessing, model training with SGD optimizer, validation, and model checkpointing for reusability.

## Features
- Custom ResNet model for flower image classification
- Data preprocessing with resizing, normalization, and augmentation
- Training using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer
- Validation during training for monitoring model performance
- Checkpointing to save and load model for future use

## Installation
